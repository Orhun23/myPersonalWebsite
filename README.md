I have never build a proper website from start to finish. This repo will encapsulate how I go from basic web dev knowledge to a fullstackdeveloper.  

the first step that I will have to do is build the html part of the website 
this will give me the backbone of the project and will show me how everything comes along

after this i will have to make this all pretty with the use of css. 

when i have finished the css and html part of my website i will have a website looking page that does 
exactly nothing lmao 

this is where the javascript comes into play. javascript will help me to make everything working smoothly also if i want to have redirects or whatever. 
all of that will be done with javascript. 
I have heard stuff like react and jquery which i am not sure or what it means. 

i will do a bit more research and after that i will just try to build a simple website. 

holy fuck ik moet hier echt aan gaan beginnen gap 


so  a bit later then expected butttt i think i have found what developers mean with 'i hate ui designers'.
because whatever they designed is in a thing that they like to use soooo really freakishly hard to make it work
hmmmm hard stuff. i dont really know where to go from here and how to change stuff to make it work better. 
maybe just an easier html template? 
tbh i dont need much to make it work just your average ez site will do too i think but yes first session went like this.
