I have never build a proper website from start to finish. This repo will encapsulate how I go from basic web dev knowledge to a fullstackdeveloper.  

the first step that I will have to do is build the html part of the website 
this will give me the backbone of the project and will show me how everything comes along

after this i will have to make this all pretty with the use of css. 

when i have finished the css and html part of my website i will have a website looking page that does 
exactly nothing lmao 

this is where the javascript comes into play. javascript will help me to make everything working smoothly also if i want to have redirects or whatever. 
all of that will be done with javascript. 
I have heard stuff like react and jquery which i am not sure or what it means. 

i will do a bit more research and after that i will just try to build a simple website. 

holy fuck ik moet hier echt aan gaan beginnen gap
